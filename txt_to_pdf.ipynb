      "ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY-SEVEN CENTS. That was all. And sixty \n",
      "cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by \n",
      "bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher \n",
      "until one's cheek burned with the silent imputation of parsimony \n",
      "that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. \n",
      "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be \n",
      "Christmas. \n",
      "There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the \n",
      "shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the \n",
      "moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, \n",
      "with sniffles predominating. \n",
      "While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the \n",
      "first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat \n",
      "at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it cer­\n",
      "tainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad. \n",
      "In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter \n",
      "would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger \n",
      "could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing \n",
      "the name 'Mr. James Dillingham Young.' \n",
      "The 'Dillingham' had been flung to the breeze during a former \n",
      "period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per \n",
      "week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of \n",
      "'Dillingham' looked blurred, as though they were thinking seri­\n",
      "ously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever \n",
      "Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat \n",
      "above he was called 'Jim' and greatly hugged by Mrs. James \n",

      "all very good. \n",
      "Delia finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the \n",
      "powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a \n",
      "grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow \n",
      "would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to \n",
      "buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for 2 O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES \n",
      "months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. \n",
      "Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always \n",
      "are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy \n",
      "hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Some­\n",
      "thing fine and rare and sterling - something just a little bit near to \n",
      "being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim. \n",
      "There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Per­\n",
      "haps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very \n",
      "agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence \n",
      "of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his \n",
      "looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art. \n",
      "Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the \n",
      "glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its \n",
      "colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair \n",
      "and let it fall to its full length. \n",
      "Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham \n",
      "Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold \n",
      "watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other \n",
      "was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the \n",
      "airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some \n",
      "day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had \n",
      "King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the \n",
      "basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he \n",
      "passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy. \n",
      "So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shin­\n",
      "ing like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and \n",
      "made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again \n",
      "nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood \n",
      "still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet. \n",
      "On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. \n",
      "With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her \n",
      "eyes, she fluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the \n",
      "street. \n",
      "Where she stopped the sign read: 'Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods \n",
      "of All Kinds.' One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, pant­\n",
      "ing. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the 'Sofronie.' \n",
      "'Will you buy my hair?' asked Della. \n",
      "'I buy hair,' said Madame. 'Take yer hat off and let's have a \n",
      "sight at the looks of it.' \n",
      "Down rippled the brown cascade. \n",
      "'Twenty dollars,' said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised \n",
      "hand. O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES 3 \n",
      "'Give it to me quick,' said Della. \n",
      "Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget \n",
      "the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's \n",
      "present. \n",
      "She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one \n",
      "else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had \n",
      "turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple \n",
      "and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance \n",
      "alone and not by meretricious ornamentation - as all good things \n",
      "should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it \n",
      "she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and \n",
      "value - the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they \n",
      "took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. \n",
      "With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about \n",
      "the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes \n",
      "looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he \n",
      "used in place of a chain. \n",
      "When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to \n",
      "prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the \n",
      "gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity \n",
      "added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends - a \n",
      "mammoth task. \n",
      "Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-\n",
      "lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. \n",
      "She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and \n",
      "critically. \n",
      "'If Jim doesn't kill me,' she said to herself, 'before he takes a \n",
      "second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. \n",
      "But what could I do - oh! what could I do with a dollar and \n",
      "eighty-seven cents?' \n",
      "At seven o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on \n",
      "the back of the stove, hot and ready to cook the chops. \n",
      "Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and \n",
      "sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. \n",
      "Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, \n",
      "and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying \n",
      "little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now \n",
      "she whispered: 'Please God, make him think I am still pretty.' \n",
      "The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked \n",
      "thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two - and \n",
      "to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he \n",
      "was without gloves. 4 O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES \n",
      "Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the \n",
      "scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an \n",
      "expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It \n",
      "was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any \n",
      "of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared \n",
      "at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face. \n",
      "Della wriggled off the table and went for him. \n",
      "'Jim, darling,' she cried, 'don't look at me that way. I had my \n",
      "hair cut off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through \n",
      "Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again - you \n",
      "won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully \n",
      "fast. Say \"Merry Christmas!\" Jim, and let's be happy. You don't \n",
      "know what a nice - what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you.' \n",
      "'You've cut off your hair?' asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had \n",
      "not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental \n",
      "labour. \n",
      "'Cut it off and sold it,' said Della. 'Don't you like me just as \n",
      "well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?' \n",
      "Jim looked about the room curiously. \n",
      "'You say your hair is gone?' he said with an air almost of idiocy. \n",
      "'You needn't look for it,' said Della. 'It's sold, I tell you - sold \n",
      "and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went \n",
      "for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,' she went on \n",
      "with a sudden serious sweetness, 'but nobody could ever count my \n",
      "love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?' \n",
      "Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his \n",
      "Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some \n",
      "inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week \n",
      "or a million a year - what is the difference? A mathematician or a \n",
      "wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable \n",
      "gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be \n",
      "illuminated later on. \n",
      "Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon \n",
      "the table. \n",
      "'Don't make any mistake, Dell,' he said, 'about me. I don't think \n",
      "there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo \n",
      "that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that \n",
      "package you may see why you had me going awhile at first.' \n",
      "White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then \n",
      "an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to \n",
      "hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment \n",
      "of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat. O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES 5 \n",
      "For there lay The Combs - the set of combs, side and back, that \n",
      "Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful \n",
      "combs, pure tortoiseshell, with jewelled rims - just the shade to \n",
      "wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, \n",
      "she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them \n",
      "without the least hope of possession. And now they were hers, but \n",
      "the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were \n",
      "gone. \n",
      "But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able \n",
      "to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: 'My hair grows so \n",
      "fast, Jim!' \n",
      "And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, 'Oh, \n",
      "oh!' \n",
      "Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to \n",
      "him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed \n",
      "to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit. \n",
      "'Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll \n",
      "have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your \n",
      "watch. I want to see how it looks on it.' \n",
      "Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his \n",
      "hands under the back of his head and smiled. \n",
      "'Dell,' said he, 'let's put our Christmas presents away and keep \n",
      "'em awhile. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the \n",
      "watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you \n",
      "put the chops on.' \n",
      "The magi, as you know, were wise men - wonderfully wise men \n",
      "- who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the \n",
      "art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no \n",
      "doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case \n",
      "of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the unevent­\n",
      "ful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely \n",
      "sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But \n",
      "in a last word to the wise of these days, let it be said that of all who \n",
      "give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive \n",
      "gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are \n",
      "the magi. 6 O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES \n",

      "A Cosmopolite in a Café \n",
      "AT MIDNIGHT THE CAFÉ was crowded. By some chance the little \n",
      "table at which I sat had escaped the eye of incomers, and two \n",
      "vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the \n",
      "influx of patrons. \n",
      "And then a cosmopolite sat in one of them, and I was glad, for \n",
      "I held a theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has \n",
      "existed. We hear of them, and we see foreign labels on much \n",
      "luggage, but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites. \n",
      "I invoke your consideration of the scene - the marble-topped \n",
      "tables, the range of leather-upholstered wall seats, the gay com­\n",
      "pany, the ladies dressed in demi-state toilets, speaking in an \n",
      "exquisite visible chorus of taste, economy, opulence or art, the \n",
      "sedulous and largess-loving garçons, the music wisely catering to all \n",
      "with its raids upon the composers; the mélange of talk and laughter \n",

      "to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a \n",

      "scene was truly Parisian. \n",
      "My cosmopolite was named E. Rushmore Coglan, and he will \n",
      "be heard from next summer at Coney Island. He is to establish a \n",
      "new 'attraction' there, he informed me, offering kingly diversion. \n",
      "And then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and lon­\n",
      "gitude. He took the great, round world in his hand, so to speak, \n",
      "familiarly, contemptuously, and it seemed no larger than the seed \n",
      "of a Maraschino cherry in a table-d'hôte grape fruit. He spoke dis­\n",
      "respectfully of the equator, he skipped from continent to conti­\n",
      "nent, he derided the zones, he mopped up the high seas with his \n",
      "napkin. With a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain \n",
      "bazaar in Hyderabad. Whiff! He would have you on skis in Lap­\n",
      "land. Zip! Now you rode the breakers with the Kanakas at \n",
      "Kealaikahiki. Presto! He dragged you through an Arkansas post-\n",
      "oak swamp, let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his \n",

      "that it would be delivered to him. \n",
      "I was sure that I had at last found the one true cosmopolite since \n",
      "Adam, and I listened to his world-wide discourse fearful lest I \n",
      "should discover in it the local note of the mere globe-trotter. But \n",
      "his opinions never fluttered or drooped; he was as impartial to \n",
      "cities, countries and continents as the winds or gravitation. \n",
      "And as E. Rushmore Coglan prattled of this little planet I \n",
      "thought with glee of a great almost-cosmopolite who wrote for the \n",
      "whole world and dedicated himself to Bombay. In a poem he has \n",
      "to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the \n",
      "earth, and that 'the men that breed from them, they traffic up and \n",
      "down, but cling to their cities' hem as a child to the mother's \n",

      "remember their native city 'most faithful, foolish, fond; making \n",
      "her mere-breathed name their bond upon their bond.' And my \n",
      "glee was roused because I had caught Mr. Kipling napping. Here I \n",
      "had found a man not made from dust; one who had no narrow \n",
      "boasts of birthplace or country, one who, if he bragged at all, \n",
      "would brag of his whole round globe against the Martians and the \n",
      "inhabitants of the Moon. \n",
      "Expression on these subjects was precipitated from E. Rush-\n",
      "more Coglan by the third corner to our table. While Coglan was \n",
      "describing to me the topography along the Siberian Railway the \n",
      "orchestra glided into a medley. The concluding air was 'Dixie,' \n",
      "and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost over­\n",
      "powered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table. \n",
      "It is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be \n",
      "witnessed every evening in numerous cafés in the City of New \n",
      "York. Tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account \n",
      "for it. Some have conjectured hastily that all Southerners in town \n",
      "hie themselves to cafés at nightfall. This applause of the 'rebel' air \n",
      "in a Northern city does puzzle a little; but it is not insolvable. The \n",
      "war with Spain, many years' generous mint and water-melon \n",
      "crops, a few long-shot winners at the New Orleans race-track, and \n",

      "When 'Dixie' was being played a dark-haired young man \n",
      "sprang up from somewhere with a Mosby guerrilla yell and waved \n",
      "frantically his soft-brimmed hat. Then he strayed through the \n",

      "The evening was at the period when reserve is thawed. One of \n",

      "The hibernatorial ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. \n",
      "In them were no considerations of Mediterranean cruises, of \n",
      "soporific Southern skies or drifting in the Vesuvian Bay. Three \n",
      "months on the Island was what his soul craved. Three months of \n",
      "assured board and bed and congenial company, safe from Boreas \n",
      "and bluecoats, seemed to Soapy the essence of things desirable. \n",
      "For years the hospitable Blackwell's had been his winter quar­\n",
      "ters. Just as his more fortunate fellow New Yorkers had bought \n",
      "their tickets to Palm Beach and the Riviera each winter, so Soapy \n",
      "had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the \n",
      "Island. And now the time was come. On the previous night three \n",
      "Sabbath newspapers, distributed beneath his coat, about his ankles \n",
      "and over his lap, had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his \n",
      "bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square. So the \n",
      "Island loomed large and timely in Soapy's mind. He scorned the \n",
      "provisions made in the name of charity for the city's dependents. O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES 33 \n",
      "In Soapy's opinion the Law was more benign than Philanthropy. \n",
      "There was an endless round of institutions, municipal and \n",
      "eleemosynary, on which he might set out and receive lodging and \n",
      "food accordant with the simple life. But to one of Soapy's proud \n",
      "spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered. If not in coin you must \n",
      "pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands \n",
      "of philanthropy. As Caesar had his Brutus, every bed of charity \n",
      "must have its toll of a bath, every loaf of bread its compensation of \n",
      "a private and personal inquisition. Wherefore it is better to be a \n",
      "guest of the law, which, though conducted by rules, does not \n",
      "meddle unduly with a gentleman's private affairs. \n",
      "Soapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about \n",
      "accomplishing his desire. There were many easy ways of doing \n",
      "this. The pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive \n",
      "restaurant; and then, after declaring insolvency, be handed over \n",
      "quietly and without uproar to a policeman. An accommodating \n",
      "magistrate would do the rest. \n",
      "Soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across \n",
      "the level sea of asphalt, where Broadway and Fifth Avenue flow \n",
      "together, Up Broadway he turned, and halted at a glittering café, \n",
      "where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the \n",
      "grape, the silkworm and the protoplasm. \n",
      "Soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest \n",
      "upward. He was shaven, and his coat was decent and his neat black, \n",
      "ready-tied four-in-hand had been presented to him by a lady mis­\n",
      "sionary on Thanksgiving Day. If he could reach a table in the restau­\n",
      "rant unsuspected success would be his. The portion of him that \n",
      "would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter's \n",
      "mind. A roasted mallard duck, thought Soapy, would be about the \n",
      "thing - with a bottle of Chablis, and then Camembert, a demi-tasse \n",
      "and a cigar. One dollar for the cigar would be enough. The total \n",
      "would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of \n",
      "revenge from the café management; and yet the meat would leave \n",
      "him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge. \n",
      "But as Soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head \n",
      "waiter's eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes. \n",
      "Strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in \n",
      "silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of \n",
      "the menaced mallard. \n",
      "Soapy turned off Broadway. It seemed that his route to the cov­\n",
      "eted Island was not to be an epicurean one. Some other way of \n",
      "entering limbo must be thought of. 34 O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES \n",
      "At a corner of Sixth Avenue electric lights and cunningly dis­\n",
      "played wares behind plate-glass made a shop window conspicuous. \n",
      "Soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass. People \n",
      "came running round the corner, a policeman in the lead. Soapy \n",
      "stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of \n",
      "brass buttons. \n",
      "'Where's the man that done that?' inquired the officer excitedly. \n",
      "'Don't you figure out that I might have had something to do \n",
      "with it?' said Soapy, not without sarcasm, but friendly, as one \n",
      "greets good fortune. \n",
      "The policeman's mind refused to accept Soapy even as a clue. \n",
      "Men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law's \n",
      "minions. They take to their heels. The policeman saw a man half­\n",
      "way down the block running to catch a car. With drawn club he \n",
      "joined in the pursuit. Soapy, with disgust in his heart, loafed \n",
      "along, twice unsuccessful. \n",
      "On the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great \n",
      "pretensions. It catered to large appetites and modest purses. Its \n",
      "crockery and atmosphere were thick; its soup and napery thin. \n",
      "Into this place Soapy took his accusive shoes and tell-tale trousers \n",
      "without challenge. At a table he sat and consumed beefsteak, flap­\n",
      "jacks, doughnuts and pie. And then to the waiter he betrayed the \n",
      "fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers. \n",
      "'Now, get busy and call a cop,' said Soapy. 'And don't keep a \n",
      "gentleman waiting.' \n",
      "'No cop for youse,' said the waiter, with a voice like butter cakes \n",
      "and an eye like the cherry in a Manhattan cocktail. 'Hey, Con!' \n",
      "Neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters \n",
      "pitched Soapy. He arose, joint by joint, as a carpenter's rule opens, \n",
      "and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed but a rosy \n",
      "dream. The Island seemed very far away. A policeman who stood \n",
      "before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the \n",
      "street. \n",
      "Five blocks Soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to \n",
      "woo capture again. This time the opportunity presented what he \n",
      "fatuously termed to himself a 'cinch.' A young woman of a modest \n",
      "and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with \n",
      "sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands, and \n",
      "two yards from the window a large policeman of severe \n",
      "demeanour leaned against a water-plug. \n",
      "It was Soapy's design to assume the role of the despicable and \n",
      "execrated 'masher.' The refined and elegant appearance of his O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES 35 \n",
      "victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him \n",
      "to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon \n",
      "his arm that would ensure his winter quarters on the right little, \n",
      "tight little isle. \n",
      "Soapy straightened the lady missionary's ready-made tie, \n",

      "was taken with sudden coughs and 'hems,' smiled, smirked and \n",
      "went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of \n",
      "the 'masher.' With half an eye Soapy saw that the policeman was \n",
      "watching him fixedly. The young woman moved away a few steps, \n",
      "and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving \n",
      "mugs. Soapy followed, boldly stepping to her side, raised his hat \n",
      "and said: \n",
      "'Ah there, Bedelia! Don't you want to come and play in my \n",

      "The policeman was still looking. The persecuted young woman \n",
      "had but to beckon a finger and Soapy would be practically en route \n",
      "for his insular haven. Already he imagined he could feel the cosy \n",
      "warmth of the station-house. The young woman faced him and, \n",
      "stretching out a hand, caught Soapy's coat-sleeve. \n",
      "'Sure, Mike,' she said joyfully, 'if you'll blow me to a pail of \n",
      "suds. I'd have spoke to you sooner, but the cop was watching.' \n",
      "With the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak \n",
      "Soapy walked past the policeman, overcome with gloom. He \n",
      "seemed doomed to liberty. \n",
      "At the next corner he shook off his companion and ran. He \n",
      "halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets, \n",
      "hearts, vows and librettos. Women in furs and men in greatcoats \n",
      "moved gaily in the wintry air. A sudden fear seized Soapy that some \n",
      "dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest. The \n",
      "thought brought a little of panic upon it, and when he came upon \n",
      "another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent \n",
      "theatre he caught at the immediate straw of 'disorderly conduct.' \n",
      "On the sidewalk Soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the \n",

      "disturbed the welkin. \n",
      "The policeman twirled his club, turned his back to Soapy and \n",
      "remarked to a citizen: \n",

      "Disconsolate, Soapy ceased his unavailing racket. Would never a \n",
      "policeman lay hands on him? In his fancy the Island seemed an \n",
      "unattainable Arcadia. He buttoned his thin coat against the chilling \n",
      "wind. \n",
      "In a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man lighting a cigar at a \n",
      "swinging light. His silk umbrella he had set by the door on enter­\n",
      "ing. Soapy stepped inside, secured the umbrella and sauntered off \n",
      "with it slowly. The man at the cigar light followed hastily. \n",
      "'My umbrella,' he said sternly. \n",
      "'Oh, is it?' sneered Soapy, adding insult to petit larceny. 'Well, \n",
      "why don't you call a policeman? I took it. Your umbrella! Why \n",
      "don't you call a cop? There stands one at the corner.' \n",
      "The umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise, with a \n",
      "presentiment that luck would again run against him. The policeman \n",
      "looked at the two curiously. \n",
      "'Of course,' said the umbrella man - 'that is - well, you know \n",
      "how these mistakes occur - I - if it's your umbrella I hope you'll \n",
      "excuse me - I picked it up this morning in a restaurant - If you \n",

      "'Of course it's mine,' said Soapy viciously. \n",
      "The ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to assist \n",

      "car that was approaching two blocks away. \n",
      "Soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improve­\n",

      "muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs. \n",
      "Because he wanted to fall into their clutches, they seemed to \n",
      "regard him as a king who could do no wrong. \n",
      "At length Soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where \n",
      "the glitter and turmoil was but faint. He set his face down this \n",
      "toward Madison Square, for the homing instinct survives even \n",
      "when the home is a park bench. \n",
      "But on an unusually quiet corner Soapy came to a standstill. \n",
      "Here was an old church, quaint and rambling and gabled. \n",

      "the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron \n",

      "such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and \n",
      "immaculate thoughts and collars. \n",
      "The conjunction of Soapy's receptive state of mind and the \n",

      "he had tumbled, the degraded days, unworthy desires, dead hopes, \n",
      "wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence. \n",
      "And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this \n",
      "novel mood. An instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to \n",

      "nized as correct by the magazines. I've fought for it for three \n",
      "years, and I'm down to my last dollar, with two months' rent due.' \n",
      "'I have applied the opposite of your theory,' said the editor, 'in \n",
      "selecting the fiction for the Minerva Magazine. The circulation has \n",
      "gone up from ninety thousand to - ' \n",
      "'Four hundred thousand,' said Dawe. 'Whereas it should have \n",
      "been boosted to a million.' \n",

      "'I will. If you'll give me about half an hour of your time I'll \n",
      "prove to you that I am right. I'll prove it by Louise.' \n",
      "'Your wife!' exclaimed Westbrook. 'How?' \n",
      "'Well, not exactly by her, but with her,' said Dawe. 'Now, you 336 O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES \n",
      "know how devoted and loving Louise has always been. She thinks \n",
      "I'm the only genuine preparation on the market that bears the old \n",
      "doctor's signature. She's been fonder and more faithful than ever, \n",
      "since I've been cast for the neglected genius part.' \n",
      "'Indeed, she is a charming and admirable life companion,' \n",
      "agreed the editor. 'I remember what inseparable friends she and \n",
      "Mrs. Westbrook once were. We are both lucky chaps, Shack, to \n",
      "have such wives. You must bring Mrs. Dawe up some evening \n",
      "soon, and we'll have one of those informal chafing-dish suppers \n",
      "that we used to enjoy so much.' \n",
      "'Later,' said Dawe. 'When I get another shirt. And now I'll tell \n",
      "you my scheme. When I was about to leave home after breakfast -\n",
      "if you can call tea and oatmeal breakfast - Louise told me she was \n",
      "going to visit her aunt in Eighty-ninth Street. She said she would \n",

      "'Twenty-seven minutes to three,' said Westbrook, scanning his \n",
      "timepiece. \n",
      "'We have just enough time,' said Dawe. 'We will go to my flat \n",
      "at once. I will write a note, address it to her and leave it on the \n",
      "table where she will see it as she enters the door. You and I will be \n",
      "in the dining-room concealed by the portieres. In that note I'll say \n",
      "that I have fled from her for ever with an affinity who understands \n",
      "the needs of my artistic soul as she never did. When she reads it \n",
      "we will observe her actions and hear her words. Then we will \n",
      "know which theory is the correct one - yours or mine.' \n",
      "'Oh, never!' exclaimed the editor, shaking his head. 'That would \n",
      "be inexcusably cruel. I could not consent to have Mrs. Dawe's \n",
      "feelings played upon in such a manner.' \n",
      "'Brace up,' said the writer. 'I guess I think as much of her as you \n",
      "do. It's for her benefit as well as mine. I've got to get a market for \n",
      "my stories in some way. It won't hurt Louise. She's healthy and \n",
      "sound. Her heart goes as strong as a ninety-eight-cent watch. It'll \n",
      "last for only a minute, and then I'll step out and explain to her. \n",
      "You really owe it to me to give me the chance, Westbrook.' \n",
      "Editor Westbrook at length yielded, though but half willingly. \n",
      "And in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that \n",
